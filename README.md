# Trader-Behavior-Insights-Analysis

ðŸ§  Objective:-

* To analyze how market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) affects trader behavior and profitability. The project combines historical trading data with sentiment indicators to extract actionable insights and recommend smarter trading strategies.

ðŸ“Š Datasets Used:-

(1) Bitcoin Market Sentiment (Fear & Greed Index):-

* Fields: timestamp, value (0â€“100), classification (Fear, Greed, Neutral), date

(2) Historical Trader Data:-

* Fields: Account, Coin, Execution Price, Size Tokens, Size USD, Side, Date, Start Position, Direction, Closed PnL, Transaction Hash, Order ID, Crossed, Fee, Trade ID, Timestamp

  ðŸ§  Project Highlights:-
  
ðŸ“ˆ EDA & Correlation Analysis: Visualize how sentiment impacts buy/sell decisions and profitability

ðŸ‘¥ Trader Segmentation: Cluster traders into behavioral groups (e.g., aggressive, consistent, risk-averse)

ðŸ§® Predictive Modeling: Random Forest Classifier to predict if a trader will be profitable on a given day

ðŸ“Š Visual Insights: Clean and interactive charts to support pattern discovery and strategic planning



ðŸ§± Tech Stack:-

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

* Jupyter Notebooks

* Data Merging

* Clustering & Classification Models

ðŸ“ŒKey Insights:-

* Traders tend to buy more during Greed and sell more during Fear.

* Losses are higher during fearful sentiment periods.

* Certain trader clusters are consistently profitable regardless of sentiment, indicating the presence of experienced traders.

* High market sentiment value does not always correlate with high PnL, suggesting overconfidence during greedy times.
